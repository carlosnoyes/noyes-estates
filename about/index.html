        <h2 id="values-title">Why We Do This</h2>
        <p>Everyone deserves a home they are proud to return to at the end of the day: affordable, inviting, functional, and full of life.</p>
        <ul class="value-list value-list--emoji">
          <li>&#127807; <strong>Beautiful Atmosphere</strong> - clean, modern design and warm, intentional spaces.</li>
          <li>&#129309; <strong>Social Living</strong> - shared spaces that encourage connection and community.</li>
          <li>&#9889; <strong>Total Convenience</strong> - fully furnished homes, utilities included, and flexible lease terms.</li>
          <li>&#128184; <strong>Affordable Price</strong> - comfortable living that does not break the bank.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="who-title">Who Lives Here?</h2>
        <p>Our residents come from all walks of life: young professionals, students, traveling nurses, and people in transition.</p>
        <p>What unites them is a desire for stress-free living in a home that feels like home. What unites us is the belief that shared housing, done right, gives people freedom and flexibility to build their future.</p>
